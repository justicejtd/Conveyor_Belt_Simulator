# Conveyor_Belt_Simulator

The purpose of this application is to simulate the conveyor belt system that the user has created and to see how it will handle under certain amount of resources.
With this application you can build your own conveyor belt path, input any number of resources (Flights, Employees, Carts) and the application will calculate how much resource is actually required, it will determine the shortest path from point a to b using the Dijkstra's algorithm.
